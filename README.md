# TWITTER
----------------

Small side project I worked on in my sophomore year of university in order to gather raw data on some key word my professor supplied. Gathered tweets from twitter for data.

Project helped me to learn :
- What APIs are and how to use them.
- How to program using python.
- Cleaning and manipulation of raw data.
